When the extraLargeArray is passed into both doublerApend and doublerInsert, the doublerAppend function comes back faster.

When observing the results of the doublerInsert and doublerAppend functions, the doublerAppend function proves to be a more efficient algorithm as elements increase. The doublerInsert function uses the unshift method, where as the doublerAppend function uses the push method to add an element to the array. As the number of elements in the doublerInsert function increases, the preformance decreases exponentially. This is due to the unshift method having to loop through the array and increase the index for each element by 1, and then add an element to the beginning of the array. As opposed to the doublerAppend function, which adds the element to the end of the array without having to change the original array. Therefore you can see that the doublerApend function scales better and is a more efficient algorithm compared to the doubleInsert function.
